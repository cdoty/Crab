# Crab
Base project for the crab examples. This need to be placed In the same directory as the Tools project.
A mame folder needs to be placed in the same folder to support debugging and running the project.
The rest of the platform specific projects need to be placed inside this directory and the submodules need to be cloned.
You will also need make in your path. The examples were built successfully with make in the [pspsdk](https://github.com/pspdev/pspsdk).
